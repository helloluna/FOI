# Downloads & Resources

> *Some documents speak. Others only point to the silence around them.*

This is not just a list of files.  
It is a **memory scaffold** — a trace of what institutions reveal, conceal, or refuse to record.

Each document is a structural artifact.  
Some show presence. Others expose absence.  
Together, they testify to the architecture of silence that surrounds farmed animal suffering in Western Australia.
