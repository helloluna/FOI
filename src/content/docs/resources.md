# Downloads & Resources

This is not just a list of files.  
It is a memory scaffold — a trace of what institutions reveal, conceal, or refuse to record.

Each document here is a structural artifact.  
Some show presence. Others reveal absence.  
Together, they testify to the architecture of silence that surrounds farmed animal suffering in Western Australia.
