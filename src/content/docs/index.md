# WA Animal Welfare Transparency Archive

> *A public memory ‚Äî for those whose suffering is hidden. 
> An archive ‚Äî against forgetting.*
--- 
An independent documentation effort to expose the systemic invisibility of farmed animals in Western Australia ‚Äî and the institutions that obscure it.

This archive began with a single Freedom of Information request.

It now serves as a public record, memory structure, and structural critique ‚Äî focused on the legal invisibility surrounding Designated Inspectors (DIs), the only state-authorised individuals allowed to enter industrial farming facilities.

--- 
> **This project is not just about transparency.  
> It is about the lives whose suffering is systematically erased ‚Äî and the structures that allow that erasure.**

## ‚ùó Why This Matters

Since 2023, unauthorised filming or entry into animal farming facilities has been criminalised in WA. This leaves Designated Inspectors (DIs) as the sole legal witnesses inside spaces where animals often endure extreme confinement, mutilation, and psychological trauma.

Yet if these inspections are undocumented, their outcomes unreported, and oversight bodies silent, **the system is not just blind ‚Äî it is designed not to see**.

What vanishes in this silence is not just institutional data, but the reality of lives endured in cages, crates, and industrial sheds.

> **Without public records, we do not know if cruelty is prevented ‚Äî or simply unseen.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Issues Identified

- No published data on DI inspections since 2022  
- AWAC does not release minutes or recommendations  
- DPIRD annual reports omit any reference to DI enforcement  
- A dataset was created only after formal FOI pressure

This archive exists because systems forget ‚Äî but we remember.  
Animals live, suffer, and die in silence. This site ensures that silence is not total.
