# About This Project

> *Not all silence is passive.  
Some is constructed.*

This is not a campaign.  
Nor a protest.  
It is a response to a silence that has become structural.

It began as a simple request:  
*What do the records say about the lives inside?*

> *They said: There are no records.*

---

> *Every system has a memory — or a deliberate absence of it.*


I work in the gap between what is **claimed** and what is **traceable**.  
This project lives in that gap — not to close it, but to expose it.

Its focus is narrow and deliberate:  
**farmed animals confined in industrial systems, whose suffering is designed to disappear.**  
Not by accident, but by *structure*.

> *Pigs. Hens. Those rendered into numbers, categories, protocols, or nothing at all.*

Not because they don’t matter —  
But because we built a world where they **can’t**.

---

## Why FOI?

> *Transparency is not the goal.  
It is the tool used to reveal the absence of accountability.*

I use FOI laws because they are one of the few levers that remain.

Not to fight.  
But to *register*.  
To document what is denied, refused, forgotten — or never considered worth recording.

> When the state cannot provide records,  
> we do not receive “no data.”  
> We receive **an admission that absence is policy**.

This is not bureaucratic process.  
It is an **ethical surface** —  
Where silence becomes something visible.

## The Repeating Pattern

> *A loop of refusal becomes a pattern.  
A pattern becomes a system.*

This project is a cycle.  
Each round is the same, and yet not:

1. **Request** — what should already exist  
2. **Wait** — for what cannot be admitted  
3. **Receive** — nothing, or something shaped to be nothing  
4. **Record** — refusal, absence, trace

And again.

> *Each repetition is a quiet defiance.*  
Not loud enough to break the silence —  
But enough to **mark that we did not join it**.

## What This Is Not

> *This is not outreach.  
It is exposure.*

This is not a call for empathy.  
Not an effort to persuade.  
I do not ask people to care.

What I ask is this:

> If institutions claim to act for animals —  
> **Then where is the trace of those actions?**  
> **Where are the records?**

If there is no memory, there is no governance.  
If there is no trace, there was no witness.

> *This archive exists so that their unrecorded lives do not vanish completely.*

---

> *Some things cannot be saved.  
But they can be remembered —  
And refusal can be named.*
