# About This Project

This is not a campaign.  
Nor a protest.  
It is a response to a silence that has become structural.

It began as a simple request:  
What do the records say about the lives inside?

They said: There are no records.

---

I work in the gap between what is claimed and what is traceable.  
This project lives in that gap—not to close it, but to make it visible.

Its focus is narrow and deliberate:  
**farmed animals confined in industrial systems, whose suffering is designed to disappear.**  
Not by accident, but by structure.

Pigs. Hens. Those rendered into numbers, categories, protocols, or nothing at all.  
Not because they don't matter—but because we designed a system where they can’t.

## Why FOI?

I use FOI laws because they are one of the few levers that remain.

Not to fight.  
But to *register*.  
To document what is denied, refused, forgotten—or never thought necessary to record.

When the state cannot provide records, we do not receive “no data.”  
We receive **an admission that absence is policy**.

This is not bureaucratic process.  
It is an ethical surface—where silence becomes something visible.

## The Repeating Pattern

This project is a loop.  
Each cycle is the same, and each is different:

1. **Request** — for what should already exist  
2. **Wait** — for what cannot be admitted  
3. **Receive** — nothing, or something shaped to be nothing  
4. **Record** — refusal, absence, trace

And again.  
Each repetition leaves a dent in the silence.  
Not enough to break it.  
But enough to say: we were not silent with it.

## What This Is Not

This is not a call for empathy.  
Not an effort to persuade.  
I do not ask people to care.

What I ask is this:  
If institutions claim to act for animals, **then where is the trace of those actions?**  
Where are the records?

If there is no memory, there is no governance.  
If there is no trace, there was no witness.

This archive exists **so that their unrecorded lives do not vanish completely**.
