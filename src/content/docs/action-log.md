# Action Log – WA Animal Welfare Transparency  
**Maintained by Hanyu Liu**  
_Last updated: June 2025_

This is a structural record — not of what was achieved,  
but of what was attempted, requested, refused, and left undocumented.

Each entry is part of a wider cycle:  
→ Legal request → Institutional response or silence → Public memory trace.  
This log preserves that cycle,  
**not as progress — but as accountability.**

**Summary:**  
- No internal audits, enforcement outcomes, or DI-related data was found to exist.  
- One document created post-request: a generic checklist with no substantive findings.  
- Systemic silence formally acknowledged through a Section 26 refusal.
